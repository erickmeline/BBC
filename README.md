Requirements:

**User Story**

_AS A marketing agency_

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

**Acceptance Criteria**

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

1. WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
1. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
1. WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
1. WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
1. WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


I had a question on this part of the acceptance criteria:

*WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order*

This implies that the <h> elements were not decending properly in the original source, however they already were. If I'm missing the meaning of this requirement, please clarify the instructions.

I know that 10 commits was requested for this, but I can't imagine how to get there. I think I had maybe 3.

p.s. This line from the assignment page is misleading:
*"To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability."*

Not true. A developer should never stray from the spec'd scope of work.
