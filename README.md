# Another Portfolio Page (homework 8)

## Description

Another portfolio page. I really don't feel comfortable with this assignment of sharing my personal information like this, open to public scrapers. I also don't feel comfortable using class assignments as professional examples of my work. Never-the-less, this branch is to fulfill the requirement.

Also, I've run into a bit of an issue with this one and linking assignments with the way I set up my github for classwork as a repository, and my assignments as branches of that repository. Seemed sane at the time in order to keep class assignments segregated from the other things I had in git, but now I can only have one class assignment deployed at a time, so linking to the demo of them is impossible.
